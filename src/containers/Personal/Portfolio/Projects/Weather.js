                <p>Since the beginning of time, humans used to predict weather just by looking into skies.
                    Sometimes they would be right, more often wrong. But, no more!
<br></br>
                    Introducing Weather 360°, web-site that shows weather around the globe!
                    Look for current and future weather for any city on Earth (hope to include Lunar
                    colonies and even Martian colonies including Utopia Planitia in near future!). See
                    the cities location on a map and even roam the city streets using Pegman in full-screen mode. Just like the simulations!

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This is made with collaboration between three different API's (OpenWeather API, DarkSky API and Google maps API) 
                    and a proxy. My choice in deciding which API's to use was mainly in their simplicity. I started this project 
                    using DarkSky API. In order to make the DarkSky API to work, I had to use a proxy to bypass CORS problem. I 
                    googled how to bypass cors and found this nice proxy CORS anywhere solution, which is described as an API that 
                    enables cross-origin requests to anywhere. After that problem, I found out that DarkSky API can only locate a 
                    city based on it's coordinates, which restricted it and made complicated for user to use (it is simpler to type 
                    city name instead of latitude and longtitude). This is when I found about OpenWeather API. This API uses only 
                    city name to search it's database of weather information but has restricted access to some information and in 
                    order to get same amount of data as in DarkSky API, I would need to pay. So, I faced dilemma about which one 
                    to use and finally decided to combine this two API's and make them work together in order to give the best user 
                    experience. I took from OpenWeather API it's capability to sort through database easily just by typing city name. 
                    Once the user types city name and selects country (country selection is optional), it feeds DarkSky API with 
                    coordinates of the city and in that way I can access more information that I thought would be desirable for user 
                    to see. Also, in same way OpenWeather API feeds coordinates into Google maps API to show the user exact location 
                    of the searched city. User can use the Google maps in full-screen mode and also can go into StreetView mode but 
                    each user has a certain amount of calls to Google maps and once he reaches the limit, has to wait for it to reset.
<br></br>
All three API's and a proxy, work together to give the user as best experience and as intuitive design as they can.
