                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to allow the user to make simple operations where it could create,
                    retrieve, update and delete data. Database used is a noSQL database MongoDB.
<br></br>
                    The project is a web-site where user can post their adverts (similar to DoneDeal, Adverts, Gumtree...)
                    and buy from others and also for companies or users to rent out side spaces on the pages to promote their
                     bussines (that space is coloured in lightblue in order to be visible from rest of the site and is clickable.
                      When it is clicked, it will open a contact modal).
